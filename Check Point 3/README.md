   1. [Small Area Estimation of Expenditure Per-capita in Banyuwangi with Hierarchical Bayesian and Empirical Bayes Methods](http://iptek.its.ac.id/index.php/jos/article/view/3185)
   In this paper, it presents how to apply Hierarchical Bayesian(HB) and Empirical Bayes(EB) on the Small Area Estimation Method, which is often used to estimate parameters for sub-level in the data and solve the problem that the sub-level of the data isn't large enough. The author shows that with the help of HB and EB, the RMSE of SAE is smaller comparing with direct estimator. Additoinally, the RMSE of estimator from HB is even smaller than the EB.
