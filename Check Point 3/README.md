This is the summary of my reading documentation of the past 2 weeks:<br/>

1. Book Review:<br/>(reference: [Introduction to Applied Bayesian Statistics and Estimation for Social Scientists](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387712642))
   1. Hierarchical models in general (Ch9)


2. Literature Review:<br/>
   1. [Small Area Estimation of Expenditure Per-capita in Banyuwangi with Hierarchical Bayesian and Empirical Bayes Methods](http://iptek.its.ac.id/index.php/jos/article/view/3185)<br/>
   In this paper, it presents how to apply Hierarchical Bayesian(HB) and Empirical Bayes(EB) on the Small Area Estimation Method, which is often used to estimate parameters for sub-level in the data and solve the problem that the sub-level of the data isn't large enough. The author shows that with the help of HB and EB, the RMSE of SAE is smaller comparing with direct estimator. Additoinally, the RMSE of estimator from HB is even smaller than the EB. <br/>
   2. [Modeling of Per Capital Household Expenditure in Tanzania using Bayesian Two Levels Hierarchical Log-Logistic Approach_The Case Study of Dodoma Region](http://sersc.org/journals/index.php/IJAST/article/view/22911)
   3. [Toward a Hierarchical Bayesian Framework for Modelling the Effect of Regional Diversity on Household Expenditure](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274008292_Toward_a_Hierarchical_Bayesian_Framework_for_Modelling_the_Effect_of_Regional_Diversity_on_Household_Expenditure)
   4. [Model Criticism for Log-Normal Hierarchical Bayesian Models on Household Expenditure in Indonesia](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6396521)<br/>
   In the paper, the author dig into a measuring tool for model comparison, deviance information criterion (DIC). Extend the discussion from the previous paper discussing household expenditure hierarchical Bayesian modeling. The author use the DIC comparison of prediction result from two-parameter log-normal hierarchical model and the three-parameter log-normal hierarchical model to illustrate his idea.
   
3. Some idea for the research topic:<br/>
   This [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/grosvenpaul/family-income-and-expenditure) provides an interesting dataset of household expenditure in Philippines. It seems like the hierarchical model can suit it well.
