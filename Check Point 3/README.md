This is the summary of my reading documentation of the past 2 weeks:<br/>

1. Book Review:<br/>(reference: [Introduction to Applied Bayesian Statistics and Estimation for Social Scientists](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387712642))
   * [Hierarchical models](https://github.com/EnChiSu/Master-Thesis/blob/master/Check%20Point%203/Hierarchical%20Models.md) (Ch9)


2. Literature Review:<br/>
   1. [Small Area Estimation of Expenditure Per-capita in Banyuwangi with Hierarchical Bayesian and Empirical Bayes Methods](http://iptek.its.ac.id/index.php/jos/article/view/3185)<br/>
   In this paper, it presents how to apply Hierarchical Bayesian(HB) and Empirical Bayes(EB) on the Small Area Estimation Method, which is often used to estimate parameters for sub-level in the data and solve the problem that the sub-level of the data isn't large enough. The author shows that with the help of HB and EB, the RMSE of SAE is smaller comparing with direct estimator. Additoinally, the RMSE of estimator from HB is even smaller than the EB. <br/>
   (The mathematical derivation using Hierarchical Bayes can be your reference.)
   2. [Modeling of Per Capital Household Expenditure in Tanzania using Bayesian Two Levels Hierarchical Log-Logistic Approach_The Case Study of Dodoma Region](http://sersc.org/journals/index.php/IJAST/article/view/22911)
   3. [Toward a Hierarchical Bayesian Framework for Modelling the Effect of Regional Diversity on Household Expenditure](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274008292_Toward_a_Hierarchical_Bayesian_Framework_for_Modelling_the_Effect_of_Regional_Diversity_on_Household_Expenditure)
   4. [Model Criticism for Log-Normal Hierarchical Bayesian Models on Household Expenditure in Indonesia](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6396521)<br/>
   In the paper, the author dig into a measuring tool for model comparison, deviance information criterion (DIC). Extend the discussion from the previous paper discussing household expenditure hierarchical Bayesian modeling. The author use the DIC comparison of prediction result from two-parameter log-normal hierarchical model and the three-parameter log-normal hierarchical model to illustrate his idea.
   5. [Determinants Of Household Final Consumption Expenditures In Asian Countries_ A Panel Model, 1991-2015](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eaa/aeinde/v18y2018i1_8.html)<br/>
   The paper illustrates influential economics factors to the household expenditures and compares the model for Asian countries with the globe as baseline. These factors are:
      1. Income (represented by GNI)<br/>
      In models for Asian and the Globe, the income factors are significant in both models. However, in Asian model, this factor is smaller and less significant than Global model when GNI increase by 1%. The possible reason is that Asian has higher propensity to save comparing with the global average.
      2. Population growth<br/>
      Population growth also contributes significantly to the household expenditure in both models. However, it's found that in the Asian model the contribution is much higher per 1% population growth comparing with the global model. One of the possible reasons I'm thinking about is that we Asians emphasize more in education. Parents are willing to devote more resources to their child, such as sending them to study abroad, hoping them to be successful. 
      3. Lending Interest rate (reflect monetary policy)<br/>
      In both models, the lending interest rate has inverse impact on the household expenditure. Higher interest rate leads to lower household expenditure, and vice versa.
      4. Government total expenditure (reflect fiscal policy)<br/>
      Both models present the effect from the government total expenditures. Addtionally, expeansionary fiscal policies can be even more efficient in the short-run. The coefficicent of the factor is also higher than the monetary factor, which illustrate the importance of its influence.<br/>
      It's also found that the influence of this factor in the Asia region is much higher. My thought of this finding is that Asian countries are more collectively thinking cultures and more tend to be influenced by the public sentiment and floating information around the market. Thus, the impact from the policy might extend longer and stronger than the globe. Plus, the neutralize effect in the global model might also be the factor.
      
   
3. Some idea for the research topic:<br/>
   This [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/grosvenpaul/family-income-and-expenditure) provides an interesting dataset of household expenditure in Philippines. It seems like the hierarchical model can suit it well.
