### PyStan
> Stan is available for Python in the form of PyStan, however, the syntax is rather offputting. The model is very verbose and difficult to debug when one starts to use more complicated models.

### PyMC3
> PyMC3 is rather a perfect library for people entering into the world of probabilistic programming with Python. PyMC3 uses native Python Syntax making it easier to debug and more intuitive.
