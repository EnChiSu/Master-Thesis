Here is the summary of my reading in the past 2 weeks:

1. Literature review
   1. [Private Saving. New Cross-Country Evidence Based on Bayesian Techniques](https://repositorio.bde.es/handle/123456789/7302?locale=en)<br/>
   The paper use Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) method, which average all potential models based on weight of each model's likelihood. 
   The prior of the model is established under the concept of Bayesian Averaging of Classical Estimates (BACE), which consider only one prior and its' hyper-parameter, the expected model size, but not multiple prior of all the potential variable's prior and their hyper-parameters.
   BACE assume that each variable is independently include (or not) in the model, so the model size, or number of potential variables in the model, follows a binomial distribution.
   The likelihood function is calculated by the IV panel data estimator instead of a GMM type one, because the former allows the calculation of the pseydo-likelihood which is comparable across models since the instruent matrix is fixed.<br/>
   The result shows that financial development, fiscal policies, income effects through terms of trade and demographic variables have a great deal of explanatory power for the private saving.
   Contrastingly, the roles of permanent income, inflation and urbanisation appear to be much more limited than previous literature suggests. 
   The paper also shows that life expectancy and old-age dependency ratio changes across countries are expected to affect the saving rate. The acceleration of old-age population and increase of dependency ratio will put downward pressure on savings.
   2. [The Determinants of Urban Household Poverty in Malaysia](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26619180_The_Determinants_of_Urban_Household_Poverty_in_Malaysia)<br/>
   The paper use logistic regression and maximum likelihood to investigate important factors for the urban household poverty in Malaysia. The results shows that human capital (highest education level), marital and Chinese ethnic positively related to the household per capita expenditure. However, ownership of house, number of children below 15, number of male/female adult, number of elderly and migrants fall with increasing per capita expenditure. <br/>
   One interesting aspect, the author provides is that the decreasing number of children, male/female adult, and elderly in household with increasing per capita expenditure shows the emergence of the nuclear family in higher income households in urban areas of Malysia.
