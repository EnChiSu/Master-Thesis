# Master-Thesis

This repo documents my notes on my master thesis. You can see my complete schedule [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pWw6sddrSNcDMypCfNuy0c-1xx9mWYvlHao6QZALvXA/edit#gid=0).<br/>

My research topic is to analyze the economic effect of ASEAN integration on the living standards of member states. As observations by the German statistician Ernst Engel, which states that “the poorer a family, the greater the proportion of its total expenditure that must be devoted to the provision of food”, I use shares of food expenditure per capita as the response variable to represent living standards. There are two parts in my research: one is to look into the living standard and economic integration. The explanatory variables for economic integration are intra-regional Foreign Direct Investment, trade in goods and services, and migration. To understand how domestic infrastructure influences economic integration, my second model concentrates on the effect of these domestic factors on regional economic integration. <br/>

To better estimate the two-layer model, I will use the hierarchical Bayesian model and PyStan as my analysis plan. My data sources come from ASEAN, Asian Development Bank, IMF, World Bank, ILO, and UNCTAD.
