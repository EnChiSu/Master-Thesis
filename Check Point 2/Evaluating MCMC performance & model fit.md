# Assess *Performance* of MCMC algorithm
There are two things that we should watch closely when we use MCMC algorithm: convergence and mixing. 
1. Trace Plot


2. Acceptance rate (of MCMC algorithm)


3. Autocorrelation of parameter



4. Scale Reduction factor



# Assess *Model Fit*
1. Residual Analysis


2. Posterior fit of models


3. Bayes factors


4. Bayesian model averaging
